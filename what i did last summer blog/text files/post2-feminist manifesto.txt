This is a piece I wrote after one of the many fallouts with my family.<br>  <br>   
Disclaimer: people have found it to be extreme, liberal, obvious, enlightening, controversial, not controversial enough, and what not. I stopped listening to insubstantial criticisms a long time ago. Hence, uncensored. <br>  <br>  
Hence, I present it to you uncensored.

As a young woman in Pakistani society, I am constantly bombarded with expectations and social norms that are steeped in casual sexism. Every day, I am faced with micro-aggressions and acts of sexism that are considered "normal" by the people around me. <br>  <br>  
For example, I am expected to wear modest clothing and avoid wearing makeup, lest I be considered "loose" or "immoral". When I assert my opinions in public, I am often told to "lower my voice" or "stop talking like a man". Even my choice of career is scrutinized and limited by societal expectations, as if women can only excel in certain fields and not others. <br>  <br>  
It's time to challenge these social norms and expectations. Feminism is not just about equal pay and reproductive rights, it's about dismantling the systemic oppression of women in all its forms. It's about creating a world where women are valued for their intellect, their creativity, and their contributions to society. It's about creating a world where women are not reduced to their bodies, their beauty, or their sexual worth. <br>  <br>  
This is my radical perspective on feminism. And I, like many other young women in Pakistan, will continue to fight for our rights and challenge the status quo. We will not be silenced, we will not be intimidated, and we will not be held back by the constraints of a sexist society. The future is female, and we will not be denied our place in it. <br>  <br>
