    I am anything but a fragile soul, I’m just lost in this endless sea, <br>
    Of frustration and inadequacy, which seems to follow me. <br>
    People say I'm smart and bright, but I cannot see, <br>
    The beauty they perceive, in this fragmented identity. <br>
    <br><br>
    Angry and jealous of my brother's fate, <br>
    Treated like a king, it's hard so to relate, <br>
    When they say I am fragile, delicate, and weak, <br>
    Obviously it's humiliating, it makes me feel so meek. <br>
    <br><br>
    Maybe its pride that holds me back from asking for help<br>
    Or the love I never had, made me self-sufficient<br>
    I try to fill the void, to prove my worth<br>
    I learned to juggle, dance, and sing to mirth<br>
    Found my passions, and set a vision high<br>
    But why do I still feel as though I'll never fly. <br>
    <br><br>
    I can't express my feelings, with an artist’s grace<br>
    I can’t express my feelings, emotions, anger, I am in this race<br>
    I am not pretty, I am short, not petite, but skinny and weak<br>
    People catch me by my wrist, and make fun of me, and I can’t speak<br>
    <br><br>
    Rage fills me, I don't know how to release <br>
    At those who say women belong in the kitchen, that <br>
    My feminism, a survival mechanism, is just a lie, that<br>
    The casual sexism I receive is nothing, but it makes me want to cry<br>
    And all the ‘normal’ humiliations, and the dinner table's disdain<br>
    They are all building up, filling me with this pain. <br>
    <br><br>
    Grades used to make my parents happy, but they don’t even mean anything<br>
    This common journey that everyone takes, it makes me feel so suffocating<br>
    Finding sense in senseless things, only leads to existential unease<br>
    That's my state, it never changes, and I am but a slave to my own unease<br>
    <br><br>
    In this state of existential unease, <br>
    I search for peace, a calm breeze, <br>
    But every day is just a fight, <br>
    To prove my worth, to see the light. <br>
    <br><br>
    I may not appear calm, but inside I'm a tempest wild<br>
    Fighting for equality, for a world that's just and mild<br>
    <br><br>
    But in this chaos, I find solace in my heart<br>
    For within me, a fire burns, tearing me apart<br>
    A voice that cries out, strong and clear<br>
    That I am more than what they see in me<br>
    That I have no fear. <br>
    <br><br>
    The worst part is, I hope all that’s true. <br>
    Thank you. <br>
