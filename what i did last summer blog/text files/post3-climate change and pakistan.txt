Climate change is a pressing issue, and Pakistan is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to its impacts. I was required to do a project last year (2022) about the effects of climate change and what it meant for my community. That wasn’t the starting point of my activism but rather the pinnacle of it. I took up the project because I was already invested in the cause. I had read a few books (namingly How to Avoid a Climate Disaster by Bill Gates, and several David Attenborough documentaries). I was already a religious reader of Gates’ blog (GatesNotes) and was further impressed by the new technological advancements made in order to achieve <i>net zero</i> target set and settled on by nearly 200 counties in 2015. It ultimately aimed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees.
<br> <br>
The ideas imposed and being worked at all over the world to achieve this target never failed to amaze me. And of course I’d like to talk about all those effort another time because I’ve sit down to write a relatively different analysis. I made a mistake. 
<br><br>
I never realized or attempted to assess the progress Pakistan was making. I felt pathetic. Outdated. I finally realized I was living in a bubble the invisible but present walls of which shunned my eyes. So I finally sat down sometime last week, rolled up my sleeves, and started typing. I wanted answers. Of course, I’d read in newspapers and online dawn articles about the recent projects untaken by the government or non-profit organizations to build climate awareness in this country, but I’d never thought about it in depth. If those project are making a change after all? If we are improving at all? Or are we too living in a nationwide bubble?

I took the liberty to educate myself statistically speaking on where we stand politically, economically, and the impactful waves being felt over the country as a direct consequence of climate change.

Politically, Pakistan is taking some steps towards reducing its carbon footprint and shifting towards renewable energy. In 2018, Prime Minister Imran Khan launched the "10 Billion Tree Tsunami" initiative, aimed at planting 10 billion trees in five years to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, the country still heavily relies on fossil fuels, with 95% of its energy production coming from coal, oil, and natural gas. Additionally, khan’s politically charged campaign for the advocacy of climate change failed since we are way past ‘just planting trees’. Reinstating replantation projects in the country requires a team of technological experts to develop a system that can maintain the ecological diversity of the planted forests.

Economically, Pakistan faces significant costs in transitioning to renewable energy, but it's an investment that the country cannot afford to ignore. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Pakistan has the potential to generate up to 100 GW of renewable energy, particularly in wind and solar power. The IEA also highlights that the cost of renewable energy has decreased dramatically in recent years, making it more accessible for countries like Pakistan to adopt. In <i>How to Avoid A Climate Disaster</i> by Bill Gates, this high cost of ‘green products’ (eco-friendly products) is known as the ‘green premium’. The Green Premium is a phenomenon very much like the Pink Tax, except it’s when private companies increase the prices of green products so they are relatively more expensive than that of environmentally harmful products. 
<br><br>
Note: if you don’t know what the <a href=” https://www.investopedia.com/pink-tax-5095458”>pink tax</a> is, it’s when companies charge more for women’s products than they do for the male equivalent of these same products. Essentially, the pink tax, as its name suggests, is not really government imposed (so it’s not a tax). Though the price difference between the male and female products is not that much, it can end up costing women millions more in the long run.

The impacts of climate change are already being felt in Pakistan. According to a study by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor, over 9 million people in Pakistan are at risk of displacement due to the impacts of climate change by 2050. The country has experienced devastating floods in 2010 and 2011, which displaced over 20 million people and caused economic losses worth billions of dollars. The impact of the record-breaking floods that hit Pakistan in 2022 is devastating. Over 1,700 people and 1.2 million livestock have lost their lives, and over 7.9 million people have been displaced. The continuous rainfall has destroyed livelihoods, leaving people in dire need of shelter, food, clean water, and toilet facilities.
<br>
<br>

Despite some areas having receded, it's estimated that a quarter of the country is still under water. The impact of these floods is unimaginable, leaving communities struggling to rebuild and recover. The loss of life, homes, and livelihoods is a tragic reminder of the devastating consequences of climate change.
<br>
<br>

These floods serve as a wake-up call for Pakistan and the world to take action on climate change. The country must prioritize investment in renewable energy, implement policies that encourage the shift towards a low-carbon economy, and take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The future of Pakistan and its people depend on it.
<br>
<br>

In short and unfortunately, Pakistan really has a long way to go in reaching the goals set out by the Paris Agreement by 2050. But shifting towards the other end of the equilibrium doesn’t entail anything different, except that we must prioritize investment in renewable energy, implement policies that encourage the shift towards a low-carbon economy, and take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
